Software Setup & Troubleshooting:
The Jupyter setup is currently throwing an error. We will reinstall it on Poppy and try accessing it through the browser again. If the error persists, we will try using JupyterLite. Should JupyterLite fail as well, we will switch to VS Code with Remote SSH.

Hardware & Motor Control:
We are currently unable to control the motors due to the insufficient 5V power supply. We need to switch to a 12V power supply using a capable power cable. The system will be tested next with 12V.
